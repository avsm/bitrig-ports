To initialize OPAM, run "opam init" and follow the prompts.

Ensure that you unset MANPATH after running `opam config env`, since
overriding it replaces the entire system path on OpenBSD.

Some OCaml packages such as Core require more memory to build
than the default ulimit allows, so increase this via `ulimit -d`
if you run into problems.
